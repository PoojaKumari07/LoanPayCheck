#FEATURS
<br>
For this project we explored publicly available data from LendingClub.com. 
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 
Hopefully, as an investor anyone would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying them back.
This model will predict whether he or she will pay back our loan or not.
<br>
We useed lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are what the columns represent:

credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
<br>

<br>
int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher 
interest rates.
<br>
installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
<br>
log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
<br>

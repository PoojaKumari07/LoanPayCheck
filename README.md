#FEATURS
<br>
For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. 
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 
Hopefully, as an investor we would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying we back.
This model will predict whether he or she will pay back our loan or not.
